Rathod's Fine Dining is a modern, fully responsive restaurant website that allows customers to browse the menu, place orders, and make reservations. It is designed with a clean user interface and provides a seamless experience across all devices. The project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React (for managing the reservation and order forms).
The website features an interactive reservation system and an order placement form with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The future roadmap includes adding backend integration and email functionality for notifications.
